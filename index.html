			<p class="intro">Greetings fellow geospatial enthusiasts,
			I am Shidharth and I welcome you to my conclave of geospatial awesomeness.
			I created this blog to share my learnings and findings I have came aross
			while trying to solve various geospatial problems through automation.
			I certainly hope my implementations will help atleast a few.

			<h2>Reading/Writing GeoTiff Files with "Rasterio"</h2><br>

				<p>Rasterio is one of the most used and easy to implement python module for reading and writing GeoTiff files. The ".read()" method in rasterio yields a
				numpy array which makes it easy to perform complex mathematical calculations on the read 
				raster.

		<h2>Reading/Writing Vector Files with "Geopandas"</h2><br>
		<div class="code-description">
			<p>Geopandas is one of the most used python module for vector data analysis.
			The resulatant of the ".read_file()" method in geopandas yields a GeoDataFrame which 
			mimics "pandas" (a popular module in python for handling table type files like csv, 
			xls, xlsx, etc.) DataFrame to some extent making it easy for user to learn and apply 
			most of the functionalities of a common dataframe if they have worked with pandas before.
